# FBNeo Metal AI Integration

This document provides information about the AI integration in the Metal backend for Final Burn Neo emulator.

## Overview

The FBNeo Metal AI integration leverages Apple's latest technologies to enhance the emulation experience through intelligent gameplay assistance, improved CPU opponents, self-learning capabilities, and advanced visual features. The implementation is built on top of the following key technologies:

- **CoreML 5.0**: For secure model loading and hardware-accelerated inference
- **Metal 3.5**: For tensor operations and neural network computation
- **Neural Engine**: For optimized AI performance on Apple Silicon
- **Vision**: For frame analysis and pattern recognition

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- macOS 16+ (Sequoia)
- Apple Silicon Mac (M1/M2/M3 or later)
- Xcode 16.0 or later (for development)
- Homebrew (optional, for dependencies)

### Building from Source

1. Clone the FBNeo repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/finalburnneo/FBNeo.git
   cd FBNeo
   ```

2. Run the AI-enabled build script:
   ```
   ./build_metal_ai.sh
   ```

3. Complete the build process:
   ```
   make -f makefile.metal.ai
   ```

4. The built binary will be created as `fbneo_metal_ai` in the project root.

### Installing Models

AI models are required for optimal performance. You can use:

1. **Automatic installation**:
   ```
   ./download_models.sh
   ```

2. **Manual installation**: Place model files in one of the following directories:
   - `~/Documents/FBNeo/models`
   - `/Users/Shared/FBNeo/models`
   - `models/` directory in the FBNeo application folder

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Launch FBNeo Metal with AI features:
   ```
   ./fbneo_metal_ai
   ```

2. Access AI settings from the in-game menu (Input â†’ AI Settings).

3. Choose an appropriate AI model based on your game and desired features.
