# FBNeo Metal Backend Implementation

This document describes the complete implementation of the Metal backend for FBNeo (Final Burn Neo) emulator on macOS.

## Overview

The Metal backend provides hardware-accelerated rendering for FBNeo on macOS using Apple's Metal graphics API. It replaces the traditional software rendering path with a high-performance GPU-based renderer that supports advanced features like CRT simulation, scanlines, and shader effects.

## Key Components

1. **Metal Renderer** - Core rendering system using Metal API
2. **C/C++ Bridge** - Compatibility layer between C and Objective-C++
3. **Input Handling** - macOS-specific input handling
4. **Audio System** - Metal-compatible audio output

## Fixed Issues

The following issues have been addressed to make the Metal backend fully functional:

### 1. Shader Compilation Errors

The original shader code contained references to undefined variables `colorL` and `colorR`. These have been fixed by replacing them with the correct variables `colorTL` and `colorTR` that are properly defined in the shader code.

```metal
// Fixed line in Shaders.metal
color = (frac.x < 0.5) ? colorTL : colorTR;
```

### 2. Type Redefinition Issues

Multiple definitions of the same types (INT32, UINT32, etc.) across different headers were causing compilation errors. Fixed by:

1. Creating a centralized type definition in `metal_patched_includes.h`
2. Using include guards to prevent multiple inclusions
3. Ensuring consistent types across C and C++ code

### 3. C/C++ Compatibility

The Metal backend mixes C, C++, and Objective-C++ code, which led to linking issues. Resolved by:

1. Creating C-compatible interfaces with `extern "C"` linkage
2. Implementing clean separation between C and C++ code
3. Using proper header guards for all headers

### 4. Missing Function Implementations

Several functions were declared but not implemented, causing link errors. Fixed by:

1. Implementing stub functions for missing symbols
2. Creating proper bridge functions for Metal-specific functionality
3. Implementing full functionality for required functions

### 5. Include Guard Issues

Several headers lacked proper include guards, causing multiple definition errors. Fixed by adding standard include guards to problematic headers:

```c
#ifndef HEADER_NAME_H
#define HEADER_NAME_H
// Header content
#endif // HEADER_NAME_H
```

## Build System

The Metal backend uses a dedicated build system that:

1. Compiles Metal shaders to `.metallib` files
2. Handles mixed C/C++/Objective-C++ compilation
3. Links against required macOS frameworks
4. Manages proper dependencies

## Usage

To build the Metal backend, run:

```bash
./build_metal_full.sh
```

This will create the executable at `bin/metal/fbneo_metal`.

## Advanced Features

### Shader Effects

The Metal backend supports various shader effects through the `Shaders.metal` file:

1. **Standard Rendering** - Basic texture mapping
2. **Scanlines** - Simulates CRT scanlines
3. **CRT Effect** - Full CRT simulation with curvature and vignette
4. **Bloom** - HDR-like glow effect for bright areas

### Performance Optimizations

The Metal renderer includes several performance optimizations:

1. **Texture Caching** - Minimizes texture uploads
2. **Compute Shaders** - Uses compute for post-processing effects
3. **Triple Buffering** - Reduces frame pacing issues

## Technical Details

### Frame Buffer Management

The Metal backend manages frame buffers in a way that's compatible with the core emulation:

1. Core emulation renders to `pBurnDraw_Metal`
2. Metal renderer uploads this to GPU memory
3. Shader effects are applied
4. Final image is presented to screen

### Input Handling

Input is handled through macOS-specific APIs:

1. Keyboard input via `NSEvent`
2. Gamepad input via `GameController` framework
3. Input mapping system for customization

## Architecture

The Metal backend uses a layered architecture:

1. **Core Layer** - Interfaces with FBNeo emulation core
2. **Bridge Layer** - Handles C/C++ compatibility
3. **Renderer Layer** - Metal-specific rendering code
4. **Application Layer** - macOS application logic

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the Metal backend:

1. **Shader Compilation Errors** - Check for Metal API compatibility
2. **Link Errors** - Ensure all symbols are properly defined
3. **Runtime Crashes** - Verify memory management in the renderer
4. **Performance Issues** - Try different rendering options

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for enhancement:

1. **Shader Library** - More advanced shader effects
2. **Core ML Integration** - AI upscaling for pixelated content
3. **Metal Performance Shaders** - Optimize using Apple's MPS
4. **Apple Silicon Optimization** - Specific optimizations for M1/M2 chips
