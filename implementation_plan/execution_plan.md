## Implementation Strategy

For each component, follow this workflow:

1. **Research**: Understand the existing implementation and dependencies
2. **Design**: Plan the implementation with clear interfaces
3. **Implement**: Create the implementation focusing on correctness
4. **Test**: Verify functionality with unit and integration tests
5. **Optimize**: Improve performance without breaking functionality
6. **Document**: Add inline documentation and examples

## Testing Approach

1. **Unit Testing**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Testing**: Test components working together
3. **System Testing**: Test the full application with real games
4. **Performance Testing**: Measure and optimize performance
5. **Compatibility Testing**: Verify functionality across different macOS versions

## Deliverables

1. Fully functional Metal backend for FBNeo
2. CoreML integration for AI-enhanced gameplay
3. PyTorch/ML tools for training and analysis
4. Comprehensive documentation
5. Performance benchmarks and optimizations

This execution plan provides a structured approach to implementing all stubbed components in FBNeo Metal, with clear tasks, dependencies, and deliverables for each phase.
