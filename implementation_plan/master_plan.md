## Implementation Strategy

For each component:
1. **Preparation**
   - Review existing code and interfaces
   - Understand dependencies and requirements
   - Plan testing approach

2. **Implementation**
   - Replace stub functions with real implementations
   - Maintain interface compatibility
   - Add proper error handling and logging

3. **Testing**
   - Unit test each component
   - Integration test with dependent systems
   - Performance benchmarking

4. **Optimization**
   - Profile and identify bottlenecks
   - Optimize critical paths
   - Enhance error recovery

## Development Workflow

1. Start with core components that others depend on
2. Use feature flags to enable/disable new functionality
3. Maintain backward compatibility with existing code
4. Document APIs and implementations
5. Create automated tests for each component

By following this plan, we'll systematically replace all stub implementations with fully functional code, resulting in a complete FBNeo Metal implementation with AI capabilities.
