# FBNeo Metal Renderer for macOS

This document provides comprehensive instructions for building, testing, and optimizing the Metal renderer implementation for FBNeo on macOS with a focus on audio, build system, and performance features.

## Quick Start

To build and run FBNeo with the Metal renderer:

```bash
# Build and run the enhanced version
./build_and_run.sh [path_to_rom]

# Build with different options
./build_and_run.sh --clean --standalone path_to_rom.zip
./build_and_run.sh --demo --no-run
```

## Audio Implementation

The Metal renderer uses a multi-layered audio system based on CoreAudio/AVAudioEngine:

### Key Components

1. **Core Audio Layer**: Optimized for Apple Silicon with AVAudioEngine
   - Low-latency playback
   - High-quality resampling
   - Adaptive buffer management

2. **Audio Bridge**: Connects FBNeo core with macOS audio
   - Thread-safe ring buffer
   - Proper synchronization
   - Volume control

3. **Integration Features**:
   - Per-game audio settings
   - Audio performance monitoring
   - Latency measurement

### Audio Synchronization

The renderer provides three audio sync modes:

- **Mode 0**: No sync (highest performance, potential audio issues)
- **Mode 1**: Light sync (good balance of performance and audio quality)
- **Mode 2**: Full sync (best audio quality, may impact performance)

To change the sync mode:

```cpp
Metal_SetAudioSync(1); // Set to light sync mode
```

## Build System

### Build Options

The Metal renderer can be built in three configurations:

1. **Enhanced**: Full-featured renderer with all optimizations
   ```bash
   make -f makefile.metal enhanced
   ```

2. **Standalone**: Basic renderer for testing
   ```bash
   make -f makefile.metal standalone
   ```

3. **Demo**: Simplified demo version
   ```bash
   make -f makefile.metal demo
   ```

### App Bundle Structure

The built app bundle (`FBNeo.app`) includes:

- Compiled executable in `Contents/MacOS/`
- Metal shaders in `Contents/Resources/`
- Info.plist with permissions
- UI resources

## Performance Optimization

### Performance Counters

The Metal renderer includes comprehensive performance monitoring:

1. **Frame Time Tracking**:
   - CPU and GPU frame times
   - FPS monitoring
   - Rendering statistics

2. **Memory Usage**:
   - Texture memory tracking
   - Buffer allocation monitoring

3. **Draw Call Analysis**:
   - Count of draw calls per frame
   - Triangle count metrics

### Performance Testing

The `metal_performance_test.sh` script allows automated performance testing:

```bash
# Run a basic test with default settings
./metal_performance_test.sh path_to_rom.zip

# Run with custom duration and report file
./metal_performance_test.sh -d 60 -r performance_report.txt path_to_rom.zip

# Run verbose test with a specific build type
./metal_performance_test.sh -v -b standalone path_to_rom.zip
```

Test results are saved to both a text report and CSV file for further analysis.

### Performance Tuning

For optimal performance:

1. **Enable Performance Counters**:
   ```
   defaults write com.fbneo.metal PerformanceCountersEnabled -bool true
   ```

2. **Apple Silicon Optimizations**:
   - Uses unified memory for zero-copy texture updates
   - ARM NEON optimizations for sound processing
   - Metal shader caching

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Audio Issues

If audio is choppy or has gaps:

1. Check the audio buffer fill level:
   ```cpp
   float bufferFill = FBNeo_AudioGetBufferFill();
   ```

2. Try a different sync mode:
   ```cpp
   Metal_SetAudioSync(2); // Full sync
   ```

3. Check system load using Activity Monitor

### Performance Issues

For performance problems:

1. Enable detailed logging:
   ```
   defaults write com.fbneo.metal DetailedLoggingEnabled -bool true
   ```

2. Run the performance test script with a representative ROM
3. Check the CSV output for bottlenecks (CPU vs GPU time)

## Advanced Configuration

For more advanced configuration:

1. Edit audio buffer sizes in `metal_audio_arm64.mm` for different latency/stability balance
2. Modify shader options in `enhanced_metal_shaders.metal` for visual quality
3. Adjust performance monitoring settings in `metal_performance_counters.mm`

# FBNeo Metal Implementation Troubleshooting

## Overview
This document outlines the issues we've encountered and fixes we've applied to the Metal-based version of the Final Burn Neo (FBNeo) arcade emulator for macOS.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Frame Buffer Management
- **Issue**: Inconsistent frame buffer variables (`g_pFrameBuffer` vs `frameBuffer`) in `metal_renderer.mm`
- **Fix**: Standardized frame buffer handling to use a single global variable `g_pFrameBuffer` and updated all functions to use it

### Missing Functions
- **Issue**: Missing `VidGetWidth()` and `VidGetHeight()` functions 
- **Fix**: Added the missing functions that return the frame buffer dimensions

### Audio Issues
- **Issue**: Heavy buzzing sound from the audio callback
- **Fix**: Modified the audio callback to fill with silence by default when no proper audio data is available

### Game Rendering
- **Issue**: Test pattern was displayed instead of actual game content
- **Fix**: Added `GameRenderer_SetUseCoreRendering(true)` call when starting a game to enable the actual game rendering instead of test pattern

### ROM Loading
- **Issue**: ROM loader was not properly initializing the driver
- **Fix**: Updated the ROM loader to search for and initialize the correct driver for Marvel vs. Capcom

## Testing Process

### Simplified Test Application
We created a minimal test application (`simplified_test.mm`) to verify our Metal implementation:
- Implements basic Metal setup
- Uses our fixed renderer code
- Displays the animated test pattern
- Successfully demonstrates the Metal rendering pipeline works correctly

### Test Pattern Application
The `test_pattern.mm` provides a standalone implementation of a Metal-based renderer:
- Does not rely on any FBNeo core functionality
- Demonstrates a working Metal pipeline with animated test pattern
- Verifies our Metal setup is fundamentally sound

## Running the Project

### Simplified Test
1. Build the simplified test:
   ```
   clang++ -fobjc-arc -framework Cocoa -framework Metal -framework MetalKit -framework QuartzCore simplified_test.mm -o simplified_test
   ```
2. Run it:
   ```
   ./simplified_test
   ```

### Test Pattern
1. Build with the test pattern makefile:
   ```
   make -f makefile.testpat
   ```
2. Run the test pattern:
   ```
   ./test_pattern
   ```

### Full FBNeo Metal Build
1. Clean and build the project:
   ```
   make -f makefile.metal clean && make -f makefile.metal
   ```
2. Run the emulator:
   ```
   ./fbneo_metal
   ```

## Ongoing Work

### Next Steps
1. Integrate the fixes from the simplified test into the main application
2. Address any header conflicts between `metal_app.h` and `metal_menu.h`
3. Implement proper game audio rendering
4. Complete integration of input handling

### Known Issues
- Some header file conflicts exist between shared structures 
- The main application build still has compilation errors that need to be resolved
- Audio rendering may still need further fixes for clean sound output
