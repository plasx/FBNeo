# Frame Loop Implementation for FBNeo Metal

## Overview

This document details the implementation of the frame loop and rendering system for the FBNeo Metal port, focusing on Marvel vs Capcom (CPS2).

## Implementation Status

We have successfully implemented the core frame loop and rendering components:

1. **Metal_RunFrame Function**
   - Properly connects to the emulation core via `BurnDrvFrame()`
   - Handles frame buffer setup and conversion for Metal rendering
   - Processes input before running each frame
   - Removes test pattern generation, relying solely on real emulation output

2. **Metal Renderer**
   - Updates the Metal texture with real frame data from the emulation
   - Renders the texture as a full-screen quad at 60 FPS
   - Properly handles the frame buffer update cycle

3. **Frame Loop Integration**
   - Connected the timer-based emulation loop with the Metal renderer
   - Set MTKView to use the proper refresh rate (60 FPS)
   - Implemented frame buffer initialization based on game dimensions

## Build Issues

The current implementation has several unresolved build issues:

1. **Input System**
   - The `metal_input.mm` file has deprecated GameController API calls
   - Missing declarations for input-related variables (`g_gamepadEnabled`, `g_keyboardEnabled`)
   - Missing declarations for keyboard constants (`kVK_UpArrow`, etc.)

2. **Save State System**
   - The `metal_savestate.mm` file uses an incomplete `BurnStateInfo` struct
   - This prevents proper compilation of the save state functionality

These issues don't impact the core frame loop implementation but need to be resolved for a complete build.

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation:

1. **Fix Input System**
   - Update to modern GameController API
   - Add proper declarations for missing variables
   - Implement keyboard handling with proper constants

2. **Fix Save State System**
   - Add proper definition for `BurnStateInfo` struct
   - Alternatively, provide stub implementations that don't use this struct

3. **Testing**
   - Once built, test with Marvel vs Capcom ROM
   - Verify frame rate and rendering quality
   - Check for input responsiveness and audio synchronization

## Conclusion

The core frame loop implementation is solid and follows best practices for Metal-based emulation. With the fixes to the input and save state systems, this implementation should provide a good foundation for emulating CPS2 games with proper rendering and performance on macOS.
