# GameController Framework and Configuration UI Integration

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of GameController framework support and the configuration UI in the FBNeo Metal renderer for macOS.

## Components Implemented

### 1. GameController Framework Integration

- Complete support for Apple's GameController framework
- Support for hot-plugging controllers during gameplay
- Multi-player support with automatic player assignment
- Support for various controller types:
  - Extended gamepads (Xbox, PlayStation)
  - Standard gamepads (MFi)
  - Micro gamepads (Apple TV remote)
- Per-game controller configurations
- Persistent settings via NSUserDefaults

### 2. Configuration User Interface

- Native Cocoa configuration window
- Tabbed interface for different settings categories:
  - Keyboard input configuration
  - Controller configuration
  - Display settings
- Interactive key/button binding
- Support for per-game configurations
- Global default settings

### 3. Input System Architecture

- Modular design with separate components for:
  - Keyboard input handling
  - Game controller handling
  - Configuration management
- Clean C interfaces for core FBNeo integration
- Event-driven input processing
- Memory-efficient input state tracking

## Implementation Details

### Controller Discovery and Connection

The system uses GameController framework notifications to detect when controllers are connected or disconnected. When a controller is connected:

1. It's added to the tracked controllers list
2. Default button mappings are assigned
3. Input handlers are configured
4. The controller is mapped to a player index

When a controller is disconnected:
1. It's removed from the tracked controllers list
2. Remaining controllers are reassigned to player indexes if needed

### Input Mapping

Input mappings are stored as dictionaries that map between:

- FBNeo input codes (e.g., FBNEO_KEY_BUTTON1)
- Controller button codes (e.g., CONTROLLER_BUTTON_A)

These mappings can be:
- Loaded from saved configurations
- Customized through the UI
- Reset to defaults
- Saved per-game or globally

### Configuration Persistence

Input configurations are stored using NSUserDefaults:

- Global keyboard mappings: "FBNeoKeyMappings"
- Game-specific keyboard mappings: "FBNeoGameKeyMappings"
- Global controller mappings: "FBNeoControllerMappings"
- Game-specific controller mappings: "FBNeoGameControllerMappings"

### Configuration UI

The configuration UI is built using:
- NSWindowController for window management
- Cocoa bindings for data synchronization
- NSTableView for input mappings
- NSTabView for organizing different setting categories

## Usage Flow

1. User launches FBNeo
2. Global input settings are loaded
3. Controllers are discovered and configured
4. User can access configuration via menu (Configuration â†’ Input Settings...)
5. Changes are persisted automatically
6. Per-game settings override global defaults

## Future Improvements

1. Support for controller-specific profiles
2. Additional controller visualization in the UI
3. Force feedback/rumble support
4. Accelerometer/gyroscope input (for supported controllers)
5. TouchBar support for MacBooks
