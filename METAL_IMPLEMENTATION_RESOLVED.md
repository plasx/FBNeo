# FBNeo Metal Implementation - Resolved Version

This document describes the approach taken to resolve duplicate symbol issues in the Metal implementation of FBNeo for macOS.

## Core Problem: Duplicate Symbols

The main issue was duplicate symbol definitions between different files that were included in the build. The specific problems were:

1. Multiple definitions of error handling functions across different files
2. Multiple implementations of frame buffer management
3. Duplicated game status variables and accessors
4. Audio system duplicated interfaces
5. Overlapping implementations in memory management

## Solution Approach

The solution involves several key strategies:

### 1. Unified Implementation Files

Instead of including multiple files with overlapping implementations, we created unified implementation files for:

- Error handling (`metal_unified_error.c`)
- Frame buffer management (`metal_unified_framebuffer.c`)
- Sound globals and functions (`metal_unified_sound.c`)
- Bridge functions and memory management (`metal_unified_bridge.c`)

### 2. Careful Symbol Management

- Removed multiple definitions of the same variables and functions
- Used consistent naming across all files
- Made sure only one implementation of each symbol is included in the build

### 3. Clean Build Process

- Separated the build into distinct stages: C files, C++ files, and Objective-C++ files
- Ensured proper header usage and include hierarchies
- Used consistent compiler flags across all files

## Key Components

### Metal Bridge

The bridge connects the FBNeo core emulator with the Metal rendering system. It handles:

- Frame data transfer from emulator to Metal texture
- Input mapping from macOS to emulator format
- Audio buffer management

### Error Handling

Consolidated error handling provides:

- Consistent error codes and messages
- Logging with configurable levels
- Debug mode support

### Frame Buffer Management

Unified frame buffer implementation includes:

- RGBA8 pixel format support (32-bit color)
- Test pattern generation for verification
- Automatic conversion from emulator formats

### Running Marvel vs Capcom

The run script includes:

- ROM path validation
- Debug environment setup
- Enhanced error reporting

## Building and Running

1. Use the `build_final_resolved.sh` script to build the Metal implementation
2. Use the `run_mvsc_resolved.sh` script to run Marvel vs Capcom

## Future Improvements

- Add shader effects for CRT simulation
- Enhance controller support
- Implement save state functionality
- Add configuration UI for video settings
